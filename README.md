# dots

`dots` is yet another dotfiles management tool.

TODO: badges, plenty of them!

**THIS PROJECT IS IN ALPHA STAGE AND ISN'T USABLE YET**


## Features

* dotfiles stored in a central folder and symlinked by `dots` to their real location
* handles versioning, Git knowledge should not be required to use `dots`
* can store multiple machines configuration (one branch per machine, named after its hostname)
* private files (SSH keys, configuration files containing credentials, etc.) can be stored encrypted


## Dependencies

## Installation

TODO


## Configuration

The `dots` configuration file should be located at `${HOME}/.dots.conf`, and is organized in sections
in the same way as a `.ini` file. The configuration file can handle settings for multiple machines, so 
that it also can be synced (by default, `dots` automatically adds its configuration when the repo is 
initialized). 

The global section is `DEFAULT` (case-sensitive), which holds default values that can be overriden for in
the other sections. Each machine settings are stored in a separate section named after the machine hostname.

The values that can be used in each sections are :
* `repo_dir` : custom repository path (default: `~/dots`)
* `gpg_key_id` : ID of the GPG key to use for file encryption (default: none)
* `ignored_files` : comma-separated list of files that should'nt be synced

An example configuration can be found in the `sample-config.conf` file located in the same folder as this
README.


## Usage

TODO


## Files layout

* `dots` configuration file is `${HOME}/.dots.conf`
* dotfiles are stored in `${HOME}/dots/files`
* encrypted files are stored in `${HOME}/dots/encrypted`
* decrypted files (symlink targets) are not versioned and are stored in `${HOME}/dots/decrypted`
